## ☑️ Coding Standard Checklist

- [ ] Follow the team's standard conventions -- consistency will get us far
- [ ] Don't comment it out. Just remove (or I'll smite you 🌩️)
- [ ] Keep it simple stupid. Simpler is always better. Reduce complexity as much as possible
- [ ] Code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) -- but keep complexity to a minimum
- [ ] Be consistent. If you do something a certain way, do all similar things in the same way
- [ ] Use explanatory variables and choose descriptive and unambiguous names
- [ ] Keep configurable data at high levels. Avoid magic numbers
- [ ] Always try to explain yourself in code thinking of leaving a comment. Don't be redundant
- [ ] Use comments as explanation of intent or clarification of code or as warning of consequences
- [ ] Separate concepts vertically. Declare variables close to their usage. Related code should show vertically dense
- [ ] Objects should be small, do one thing, and hide internal data structure
- [ ] Avoid experimental framework features and libraries
